**seriespl** extracts stream-URLs for entire seasons of tv series from bs.to (Burning-Series). These URLs can then be further processed by e.g. [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/) or [mpv](https://mpv.io/).

# Install
## Dependencies
 * Linux (May work on other OS, not tested)
 * Newer than ancient clang or gcc (must support -std=c++11)
 * glibc (another libc should work, must support getopt)
 * make
 * [poco](http://pocoproject.org/) (works with 1.4.6_p4)
 * [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org/) (for the man page)

Does not work with Debian Jessie due to old libpoco-dev.
